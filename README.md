# Kalman-filter
1-D radar target tracking using Kalman filter
1-D radar target tracking
the initial position and velocity of the target is 10 m and 1000 m/s; 
the target accelerates with 20 m/s². 
The true measurement noise variance,
 the initial values of the estimated position and velocity are both set equal to 5. 
 The initial estimate of the nonlinearity coefficient is chosen as ĉ= 0.01, while the corresponding true value is c = 0.03 ;
The variable forgetting factor λ=0.9.
